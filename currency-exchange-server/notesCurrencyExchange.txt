This configuration setting specifies the URL of the Eureka server's registry.
 Let's break it down:

eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone: This is a property specific to the Eureka client 
configuration. It defines the URL where the Eureka client should find the Eureka server's registry.

http://localhost:8761/eureka: This is the URL of the Eureka server's registry.
 Here, it's specified as http://localhost:8761/eureka, 
 which means that the Eureka server is expected to be running 
 locally on the same machine as the client, 
 and it's accessible via port 8761. 
 The /eureka path is the default context path where 
 Eureka's REST endpoints are exposed.

In summary, this configuration setting tells the Eureka 
client where to find the Eureka server's registry so that 
it can register itself and discover other services within 
the microservices architecture.
