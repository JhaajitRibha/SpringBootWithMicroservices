Netflix Eureka is a service discovery server and client library.
It is part of Netflix's open-source suite of tools for building 
microservices architectures. Eureka allows services to register 
themselves with the registry and discover other services in the system.
This helps in achieving resilience,load balancing, and dynamic routing in a microservices environment.
